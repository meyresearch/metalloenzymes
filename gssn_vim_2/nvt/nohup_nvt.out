                      :-) GROMACS - gmx mdrun, 2022.2 (-:

Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /home/jguven/projects/metalloenzymes/vim_2/nvt
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -deffnm nvt -nb gpu

Reading file nvt.tpr, VERSION 2022.2 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.137

On host azuma 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 5 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


NOTE: DLB will not turn on during the first phase of PME tuning
starting mdrun 'Generic title'
5000000 steps,  10000.0 ps.

NOTE: DLB can now turn on, when beneficial


Received the TERM signal, stopping within 100 steps



Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 1.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 53%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.5%.

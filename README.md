# 1. Prerequisites 

Software requirements: 
- [BioSimSpace](https://biosimspace.openbiosim.org/install.html#easy-installation-run-in-a-conda-environment)

Useful software:
- [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart_admin.html)

# 2. System setup

- Start with a pdb file of the protein. You can save it in e.g. `inputs/protein/` in your project directory
- If your protein contains metal ions, save these in pdb format in the above directory
- Create ligand files in `*.sdf` or `*.mol2` formats and save in the same directory, e.g. `inputs/ligands/`
- If you want to keep crystallographic waters, save these in the protein directory in pdb format

# 3. Prepare meze

The workflow starts by setting up the project directory tree with the use of a python script called `prepare.py`. This script can be ran directly from the command line, or with the use of a bash script as:
```
$MEZEHOME/01_prepare.sh <path-to-input-files>/protein.pdb <ligand_charge> kpc2
```

For example, with KPC-2 with ligands whose net charge is -1:

```
$MEZEHOME/01_prepare.sh inputs/protein/kpc2.input.pdb -1 
```

Example output:
```
WARNING:root:Warning: importing 'simtk.openmm' is deprecated.  Import 'openmm' instead.
INFO:numexpr.utils:Note: NumExpr detected 32 cores but "NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS" not set, so enforcing safe limit of 8.
INFO:numexpr.utils:NumExpr defaulting to 8 threads.

No separate water file detected in working directory. Continuing without it.

Successfully prepared meze network for AFE calculations.
Run scripts saved in: /home/jguven/projects/alchemistry/kpc2/partially_protonated_ligand///afe/
```

For help with `prepare.py` run: `python prepare.py -h`

The project directory tree will then look something like: 

```
/path/to/project/
    |--- inputs/                Input files (set-up by user)
    |   |--- ligands/           Ligand .sdf or .mol2 files (set-up by user)
    |   |--- protein/           Protein .pdb file (set-up by user)
    |--- outputs/               Folder for saving the results of AFE runs
    |--- afe/                   Input files for running the meze workflow and AFE runs
    |   |--- protocol.dat       Datafile with network information
    |   |--- ligands.dat        Datafile containing ligand names, e.g. ligand_1, ligand_2, ...
    |   |--- meze_network.csv   Dataframe of transformations from lomap, including ligand names, lomap scores and lambda windows
    |   |--- 02_add_water.sh    Bash script to carry out solvation of unbound and bound ligands with solvate.py
    |   |--- 03_heat_meze.sh    Bash script to carry out minimisation and equilibration of unbound and bound ligands with equilibrate.py
    |   |--- 04_meze.sh         Bash script to carry out AFE preparation with meze.py
    |   |--- run_SOMD.sh        Bash script to run an individual AFE transformation with a given engine, e.g. SOMD
    |   |--- slurm_all.sh       SLURM script which executes all of the above bash scripts
    |--- equilibration/         Folder for saving the minimisation and equilibration outputs for unbound and bound ligands
    |--- logs/                  Folder for keeping SLURM log files
```

# 4. Run meze AFE

To run the entire workflow using SLURM, simply run:

```
/path/to/project/afe/./slurm_all.sh
```

This executes all of the above scripts (02-04) using SLURM.

Example output:

```

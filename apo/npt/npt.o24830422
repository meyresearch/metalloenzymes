Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.030 nm, buffer size 0.030 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 48x42x44, spacing 0.147 0.159 0.157

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.25

This run will generate roughly 298 Mb of data

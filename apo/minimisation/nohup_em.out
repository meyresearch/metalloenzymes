                      :-) GROMACS - gmx mdrun, 2022.2 (-:

Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /home/jguven/projects/metalloenzymes/apo/minimisation
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -deffnm em -nb gpu


Back Off! I just backed up em.log to ./#em.log.2#
Reading file em.tpr, VERSION 2022.2 (single precision)
On host azuma 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 5 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


Back Off! I just backed up em.trr to ./#em.trr.2#

Back Off! I just backed up em.edr to ./#em.edr.2#

Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  1.00000e+03
   Number of steps    =        50000

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up em.gro to ./#em.gro.2#

Steepest Descents converged to Fmax < 1000 in 711 steps
Potential Energy  = -3.5029594e+05
Maximum force     =  9.4334247e+02 on atom 2669
Norm of force     =  2.4792013e+01

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.402 nm

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.098 nm, buffer size 0.098 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.029 nm, buffer size 0.029 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

NOTE 1 [file r_nvt.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
